# Fullstack Vue: upVote!

## Introduction

This is a posting and upboting application.
It is the first project of [The Complete Guide to Fullstack Vue](https://www.newline.co/vue).

## Aims

- Provide an introduction to Vue

## New Concepts

### Stage 1

- `<div id="app">` in index.html
  - This ID is used to determine where the Vue application will be **mounted**; ie. where it will be inserted into the HTML template.
  - The Vue app will be **mounted** on to this div element.

## New Tools

### Stage 1

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/)

  - A CSS framework akin to Boilerplate.
  - The stylesheet can be directly imported into a script for direct use in HTML. That's how we've used it in this repo.

- [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/)
  - A content delivery network for NPM packages.
  - Allows you to import npm packages into scripts (without use of NPM).
  - In this repo we use it to import the Vue node package.
